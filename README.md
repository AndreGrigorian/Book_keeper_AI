Bookkeeping is the tedious process of categorizing transactions into their respective accounts.   This project looks to reduce the repetitive nature of bookkeeping by leveraging AI to reduce manual data entry.

The project has a USER interface in which users can either upload their bank statement or an excel file onto the app.

1. The app will ask what type of entity the company is to generate its chart of accounts.

2. The algorithm will generate a Trial Balance Sheet to import onto company taxes.
   a. Using Bagging Classifier for Decision Tree
   b. Zero-Shot Classification Model
   c. OpenAI's API

3. Any transaction that are unsure by algorithm will be classified into an "ASK MY ACCOUNTANT" category

4. Results are returned as a manipulated Excel file regardless of PDF or Excel Upload
