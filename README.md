Bookkeeping is the tedious process of categorizing transactions into their respective accounts.   This project looks to reduce the repetitive nature of bookkeeping by leveraging AI to reduce manual data entry. The Bookkeeping uses ChatGPT's 4.1 Model to categorize transactions into their respective accounts. Users can confirm and verify ChatGPT's transactions. These verified and confirmed transactions are stored in a dynamic storage which using the Naive Bayes Model to assess historical data. Transactions with a score > 0.8 will override ChatGPT's guesses for the transactions. The final result is a dynamic algorithm capable of discerning through data without training and with incorporating new data to make it reliable. In the end, users should receive a grouped excel worksheet with their transactions categorized.
